{
# Version 2 (uses Fisher exact when chi2 not valid). Returns (Lgt) the log of the odds against the null hypothesis that
# the  percentages of 1's before and after the putative change points
# do not differ. Also (optionally) the point (Level) beyond which the
# Chi square test is valid (because no expectation < 5)
# and (NV) the rows for which the chi square test cannot
# validly be performed (because at least one cell has an expectation
# less than 5). Syntax is [Lgt Level NV]=chi2logit(Cum,R).
# Cum is the running sum of the number of 1's. R is the vector
# of putative change points. Lgt is the logit vector, giving for each
# trial the log of the odds against the null (no change) hypothesis as of
# that trial. This version was modified in Oct or Nov 2003 so that it does the
# Fisher exact test on those tables where the chi square is not valid.
 
N1=(1:nrow(Cum)) # Creates a 3 dimensional array with the levels
# (3rd dimension nummbered in ascending sequence). The first two dimensions
# are dummy dimensions to make this array the same dimensionality as the
# ones it will be combined with. Conceptually, this is just a vector.
 
# Column totals. These are the numbers of observations (sums of 0's & 1's)
# before (1st column) and after (second column) the CP. Note that these are
# three dimensional arrays, but the first (row) dimension is a singleton,
# i.e., a dummy dimension, only 1 cell deep.
 
Level1=min(which(Cum>6)) # Finds the row (level of stacked 2x2 tables)
# below which even the Fisher exact test should not be applied, because it
# cannot yield a p value lower than .1 with fewer than 7 observations, and,
# moreover, for fewer than 4 observations, fishexct.m returns p values
# greater than 1.

  # is a 2x2 table. The rows of the table are the
  # mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (# of 1's in first row, # of
  # 0"s in second row). The columns of a level are before and after the
  # putative change point. Thus, at a given level, L, Cell(1,1,L) gives the
  # number of rewards on the given hole up to the putative change point;
  # Cell (2,1,L) gives the number of rewards on the other hole up to the
  # putative change point; Cell(2,1,L) gives the number of rewards on the
  # given hole after the putative change point; and Cell(2,2,L) gives the
  # nummber on the other hole after the putative change point. There are
  # as many levels as there are rows in the Cum vector, because the chi square test is
