  # the Nth event. The putative change point corresponding to the Nth
  # event is the preceding event at which the deviation of the observed event count

  # at any earlier event, n, is Cum(n), the interval up to the nth event,
  # divided by the average interevent interval over the range from n = 0 to n = N

  # of n at which this deviation is maximal
