cpt = function (Data,R,Crit) #[CP,L,Var]
{
# Uses t test to find first significant change point.
# Syntax is [CP,L,Var] = cpt(Data,R,Crit). Data is the vector of trial by
# trial measures or successive intervals. This test is appropriate if one
# is looking for a change in the expectation of a renewal event-generating
# process, where the interevent intervals are normally (rather than
# exponentially) distributed. Also when trial measures are normally
# distributed. R is the vector of putative change
# points. Crit is the decision criterion, the value the logit must exceed
# for the function to return a significant change point. CP is the
# first significant change point. L is the logit vector up to and including
# the row where the significance criterion (Crit) is exceeded. Var
# indicates the different possibilities for the variance estimates from the
# before and after data, to wit: Var==1 indicates that the estimates were
# both nonzero and not significantly different; Var==0 indicates that one
# of them was 0; Var==2 indicates that they were both nonzero and
# significantly different. The function uses the equal variance version of
# the t test in the Var=1 case (that is, it pools the variance
# estimates); it uses the unequal variance version of the t test
# in the second and third cases (Var = 0 0r 2). If there is no significant
# change point, CP is returned empty
